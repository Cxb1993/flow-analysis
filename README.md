# Flow analysis
I spent my 2017 summer analyzing wormlike micelle flow by looking at local shear stresses. To help me do this, I relied upon an existing algorithm (see the MATLAB files individually for citations) to locate and track tracers in the wormlike micelle flow. I built upon this by writing my own code to implement real-time tracking of the flow profile of the fluid.
